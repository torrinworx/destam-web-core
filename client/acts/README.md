The components in this folder are designed to provide higher order component like templates for entire pages. The purpose isn't to explicitely map backend modules to frontend acts/modules. The acts system is separate from the backend module system.

Acts are akin to backend modules in terms of they are configurable as are normal destamatic-ui components. The main diferentiator is that they are designed to fullfill a specific web-app related goal like authentication, user profile, post viewing, landing, signup, signin, email verification.
