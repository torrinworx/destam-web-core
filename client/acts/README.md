# acts
An individual act is a page or content instance displayed in a Stage compnent in destamatic-ui.

Read more in destamatic-ui/components/display/Stage/Stage.md.

The compnents in this folder are designed to provide higher order component like templates for entire pages. The purpose isn't to explicitely map backend modules to frontend acts/modules. The acts system is separate from the backend module system.
