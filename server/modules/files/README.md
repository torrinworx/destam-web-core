# server/modules/files

These modules are intended to be generic file upload modules. The goal is to allow them to be wrapped and customized for various purposes.

Create.js and Remove.js are designed to only be called by other wrapper modules, not directly exposed to clients.

See ./upload/ for wrapped implementations.
